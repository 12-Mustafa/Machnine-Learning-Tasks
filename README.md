# Machnine-Learning-Tasks
I worked on real-world machine learning projects, focusing on data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. I collaborated on predictive models using decision trees and neural networks, gaining hands-on experience with Python, data analysis, and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and scikit-learn.
